# The Moon't Ball

## Description

The purpose of this application is to help YOU- help YOURSELF.  On the fence about investing in Cryptos?  Well we make it easy for you to decide.  With a click of a button, you'll either be told no, it's not right for you this time, or you'll be given a great Crypto with information to invest in, or save for later.  We put a lot of thought, time, and effort into making you a go-to site for getting the answers you're looking for. All through using 3rd party API's to help gather only the greatest information and answers to give you the best experience.  This application has a few elements to look for, being things like a header with a title and a button labled to save to view any saved Cryptos you may have been interested in, a main section with a button to get the response to answer your undeciesiveness and information to read about the greatest Crypto trend you should buy, and a footer with some contact info if you're looking for some more great applications.   
The Crypto Bro's hope you enjoy!

## Usage

To get started with our application made just for you, you'll simply go ahead and give the button a shake by clicking on it. You'll be presented with either a negative response to let you know it's not time for you to buy, or a positive answer to get your foot in the door and buy.  When a positive answer is given, you'll be presented with Crypto information of a Crypto you should be investing in.  You'll also have the option to save this response for future reference if you're still on the fence.  This is done by selecting the "Save" button near the Crypto information.  You're able to access your saved Cryptos by selecting the "Saved" button in the header to show a drop down menu of the past Cryptos you thought looked good.  You can select any of these and the information will be presented to you again!
